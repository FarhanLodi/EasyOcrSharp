# EasyOcrSharp
High-accuracy OCR for .NET 9 powered by the [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) Python library. EasyOcrSharp uses a **two-package architecture** with a pre-bundled Python runtime, so you can ship a single .NET package **without requiring users to install Python or download dependencies at runtime**.
